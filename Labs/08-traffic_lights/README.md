# Lab 8: Traffic light controller

## 1. Preparation tasks (done before the lab at home)

### Completed state table

### Figure with connection of RGB LEDs on Nexys A7 board and completed table with color settings.



## 2. Traffic light controller

### State diagram

### Listing of VHDL code of sequential process `p_traffic_fsm` with syntax highlighting

### Listing of VHDL code of combinatorial process `p_output_fsm` with syntax highlighting

### Screenshot(s) of the simulation, from which it is clear that controller works correctly.




## 3. Smart controller

### State table

### State diagram
