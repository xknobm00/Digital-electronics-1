# Lab 7: Latches and Flip-flops

## Lab assignment

1. Preparation tasks (done before the lab at home). 
    * Characteristic equations and completed tables for D, JK, T flip-flops.
    
    

2. D latch.
    * VHDL code listing of the process `p_d_latch` with syntax highlighting,
    


    * Listing of VHDL reset and stimulus processes from the testbench `tb_d_latch` file with syntax highlighting and asserts,
    
    
    * Screenshot with simulated time waveforms; always display all inputs and outputs. The full functionality of the entity must be verified.



3. Flip-flops.
    * VHDL code listing of the processes `p_d_ff_arst`, `p_d_ff_rst`, `p_jk_ff_rst`, `p_t_ff_rst` with syntax highlighting,
    
    
    * Listing of VHDL clock, reset and stimulus processes from the testbench files with syntax highlighting and asserts,
    
    
    * Screenshot, with simulated time waveforms; always display all inputs and outputs. The full functionality of the entities must be verified.




4. Shift register.
    * Image of the shift register schematic. The image can be drawn on a computer or by hand. Name all inputs, outputs, components and internal signals.
